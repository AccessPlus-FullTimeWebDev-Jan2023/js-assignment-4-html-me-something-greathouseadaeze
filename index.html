            <p>During summer 2022 I was able to travel to Orlando, Fl and Atlanta, GA with my family. Two memorable food places we got to try were a hibachi grill restaurant and a seafood boil restaurant. I do not remember the names but I do remember the food was fantastic.
               The hibachi grill dinner was done in front of us on a hot griddle with a chef. At the seafood boil restaurant we received plastic bibs which was funny to wear but helped keep our clothes clean while we chowed down on some tasty seafood!

            <p>Some experiences I had during summer 2022 were getting to see my mom and little brother do IFLY, which is indoor skydiving. This was a super funny experience. My mom could not control her face during her session because of the wind blowing up in her face, which caused her to make some really funny faces. Everyone inside the building was laughing at the faces she made. We also were super close to the attraction ride where a young teen unfortunately passed away after his seat came unlocked during the attraction ride. It was very sad to drive by the memorial.</p>

            <p>Because of how nice our hotel was, we spent a lot of time at the hotel's pool and hot tub. The scenery was absolutely beautiful with palm trees all around and the lights that surrounded the pools at night. We thought about going to Universal&nbsp;Studios which was also super close to our hotel but decided to save some money and just enjoy the beautiful Florida scenery.</p>
